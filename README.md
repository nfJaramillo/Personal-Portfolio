# Personal Portfolio

This website was built in HTML, CSS and JS with Bootstrap, it contains general information about me, including experience, interests, projects, etc.

The website is deployed using Git Pages and it can be visited at: https://nfjaramillo.github.io/Personal-Portfolio/

Disclaimer: I did not place a video on the website because I feel like it ruins the esthetic. There is an iframe with a video commented within the code in the line 96. If this is uncommented a video on the website will show up. I understand if I don’t get any points for the video, but I just didn’t want it to ruin the esthetic, although I now how to place it and use it.
